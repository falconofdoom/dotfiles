# dotfiles

This project was made based on an existing set of aliases provided by sir Michael Co of Orange and Bronze Software Labs, Inc. On top of that I added my personal aliases, functions, and environment variables.

The packaging structure used here was directly inspired by Lars Kappert's blog [post][1]. Other aliases were also based off Mathias Bynens' [.aliases][2] file 


## How to run
To load the configurations made by this project just source **runcom/.bash_profile**. The script was based off Mathias Bynens' [bash_profile][3] script. Improvements such as installation scripts will be added as I go along.

Example:

```
. ~/dotfiles/runcom/.bash_profile > /dev/null
```
